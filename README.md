# samplescape
SampleScape is a game tool designed by Marcd (marcd.co) to provide an accessible platform for creating percussion-based loops. By using the arrow keys or WASD, the player can move around the landscape to collide with various objects. Each object will play either a kick, snare, clap, tom, hi-hat, vocal, or textural sample linked to its respective location in the 120-bpm-measure broken down into 1/16th notes. Select samples loop off-beat to avoid quantizationâ€”leaving room for experimentation with irregular patterns. The full build includes sliders at the bottom that can be controlled with the mouse to manipulate the overall envelope by editing the frequency cut-off, adding reverb, and setting the volume. SampleScape is meant to be used as a standalone instrument or an interactive element in a live set.
